## Current Events & Tensions

### The Succession Question

**Shogun Tora is Aging:**
- Now 75 years old (in human equivalent)
- Health declining
- Still sharp mentally but physically weaker
- No clear heir designated

**Potential Successors:**
- **General Kurogane:** Military choice. Strong, traditional, respected by Samurai class. Conservative policies.
- **Lady Koban (Daimyo of Minato-kassei):** Political/economic choice. Merchant backing, progressive, pragmatic. Would shift power toward commerce.
- **Lord Tetsu (Daimyo of Yama-takumi):** Progressive/technological choice. Engineer Guild support, innovative, younger generation. Would accelerate modernization.

**Political Maneuvering:**
- Daimyos positioning for advantage
- Factions forming and reforming
- Intrigue and alliances shifting
- Could lead to instability or even conflict
- Shogun aware but hasn't decided

**Public Concern:**
- Widespread anxiety about transition
- Memories of Territorial Wars make stability precious
- Debates in tea houses and taverns
- Some calling for new system (parliament?), others want strong Shogun

---

### Technology & Labor

**Engineer Guild's Automation:**
- New machines reducing need for manual labor
- Efficiency gains celebrated by some
- Job loss feared by others

**Worker Concerns:**
- Farmer Collective worried about relevance

**Reality Check:**

- Social safety net helps but isn't perfect

---

### Merchant Guild Power

**Economic Power Rivaling Political Power:**
- Merchant Guild incredibly wealthy
- Fund infrastructure projects
- Influence through economic leverage
- Can make or break provincial economies

**Seeking Formal Representation:**
- Want seats in government councils
- Currently political power held by Shogun/Daimyo (military aristocracy)
- Merchants feel underrepresented
- "No taxation without representation" sentiment

**Traditional Nobles Resistant:**
- Samurai class sees merchants as lower status
- Fear losing political dominance
- "Money shouldn't buy power" (ironic, but traditional view)
- Some nobles in debt to merchants (awkward)

**Could Reshape Political Structure:**
- Possible constitutional reforms
- Merchant representation in exchange for economic support
- Hybrid system emerging?
- Or backlash and crackdown?

**Wealth Inequality Concerns:**
- Growing gap between rich and poor
- Most have necessities (safety net) but some very wealthy
- Luxury in Minato-kassei vs. rural poverty
- Social mobility exists but unequal
- Populist movements emerging

---

### Native vs. Isekai'd Tensions

**Mostly Good Relations:**
- Majority live peacefully together

  - "They come here and change everything"
  - Feel culture being lost
  - Nationalism/nativism (small but vocal minority)
  
- **Some Isekai'd Cats:** Feel they're "fixing" a backward society
  - "We brought progress"
  - Condescending attitudes
  - Don't respect traditions they don't understand

**Generational Differences:**
- Isekai'd kittens born here (second generation)
- Are they native or isekai'd?
- Identity questions
- Usually integrate seamlessly
- Some face questions about "authenticity"

**Identity Questions:**
- What does it mean to be "from Neko-kuni"?
- Is it birthplace or culture?
- Can isekai'd cats ever truly belong?
- Most say yes, but debates exist

**Core Existential Struggle (Universal):**
- The adjustment from being small, dependent animals to fully sentient beings
- This affects all isekai'd cats regardless of when they arrived
- Learning to handle:
  - **Overwhelm:** "I just wanted food and warmth, now I need a career?"
  - **Purpose Anxiety:** "What am I supposed to do with this life?"
  - **Imposter Syndrome:** "Everyone else seems to know how to be a person"
  - **Decision Paralysis:** Too many choices after a life of few options
  - **Nostalgia:** Missing the simplicity of animal existence
  - **Guilt:** Feeling they don't deserve this second chance
- This is the central emotional journey of the game

### Why This World Works for an Idle Game

**The Core Loop Makes Emotional Sense:**
- You're not just grinding resources
- You're helping your cat find peace, purpose, and identity
- Every skill learned is personal growth
- Every friendship made is connection
- Every home improvement is stability
- Progress = becoming who you're meant to be

**Idle Mechanics Match Theme:**
- Cats napping generates power (solar collectors)
- Time passing = resources accumulating
- Your absence = cat lives their life
- Returns = "coming home" emotionally

**Multiple Time Scales:**
- Minute-to-minute: Small tasks, interactions
- Session-to-session: Quest progress, relationships
- Long-term: Career progression, property ownership, legacy

**Always Something To Do:**
- But never overwhelming
- Can focus on one aspect or dabble in all
- Your pace, your priorities
- Respect for player agency
