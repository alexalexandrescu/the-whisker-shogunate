## Cosmology: The Great Crossing

### The Veil Between Worlds
When a cat dies, is abandoned, or becomes truly lost in our world, they sometimes find **The Veil** - a threshold between dimensions that appears differently to each cat:
- A warm sunbeam streaming through a window
- An open garden gate
- A cardboard box that feels safe
- A quiet alley that seems to lead somewhere else

### The Landing
Upon crossing, cats arrive at **The Landing** - a misty shore where the Great Torii Gate stands, marking the entrance to Neko-kuni (Cat Country). Beyond lies a vast realm where cats have built their own civilization over millennia.

### The Eternal Question
Is this afterlife? A parallel dimension? A collective dream? The cats don't know and mostly don't care - they're here, they're alive, and that's what matters. Some philosophers debate it in the academies, but most are too busy living to worry.

### Memory of the Human World
Cats retain a vague awareness that humans and the human world exist, but specific memories fade quickly after arrival. They know intellectually that humans are real, that they came from "somewhere else," but the details blur like a half-remembered dream. This creates an interesting disconnect - they know they were once small, dependent creatures, but now they walk upright, speak, build civilizations. The transformation itself is part of the mystery.

## Geography: The Realm of Neko-kuni

**World Shape:** Neko-kuni exists on a round planet with oceans, continents, and diverse climates. The Whisker Shogunate occupies one major continent, but cats are aware of other lands across the seas.

**Exploration Status:** Most of the world has been mapped and explored by cat civilizations. Major geographic features, trade routes, and neighboring kingdoms are well documented. There are still remote regions and deep ocean areas that remain mysterious, but the age of major discovery has largely passed.

**Other Cat Civilizations:** 
The Whisker Shogunate is just one of several cat nations across the world:
- **The Whisker Shogunate** - Feudal, honor-based, technological innovators (our focus)
- **The Desert Sultanate** - Merchant princes, oasis cities, ancient libraries  
- **The Northern Clans** - Tribal confederation, harsh climate survivors
- **The Island Republics** - Democratic city-states, naval power, traders
- **The Steppe Khanate** - Nomadic empire, fierce warriors, horse-cat culture
- (More to be detailed for future expansions)

Each civilization has its own culture, government, and relationship with the Shogunate - some are allies, others rivals, some neutral trading partners.

<a name="politics"></a>
## Political Structure: The Whisker Shogunate

### The Neko-Shogun (Cat Shogun)
**Current Shogun: Tora the Scarred**
- An isekai'd tabby cat who arrived 50 years ago
- Rose through military ranks during the Territorial Wars
- United the provinces through a combination of military prowess and political skill
- Now aging (75 in human years equivalent), succession uncertain
- Governs from Shiro-tsume (Claw Castle)
- Commands absolute military authority but must navigate Daimyo politics

### The Provincial Daimyo (Lords)
Each province is ruled by a Daimyo who owes allegiance to the Shogun (see province details above for current Daimyo).

Daimyo maintain private armies, collect taxes, and have significant autonomy within their provinces. Constant political maneuvering, alliances, and rivalries.

### Social Hierarchy

1. **Shogun & Daimyo** - Ruling military aristocracy
2. **Samurai Cats (Bushi)** - Warrior class, land-owning, serve Daimyo
3. **Artisan Cats (Shokunin)** - Craftsmen, engineers, veterinarians, artists
4. **Merchant Cats (Akindo)** - Traders, shop owners, bankers
5. **Farmer Cats (Hyakusho)** - Agricultural workers, fishermen
6. **Newcomers (Shinmai)** - Recently isekai'd, no status until they establish themselves

### The Guilds
Cross-province organizations with significant power:
- **Engineer Guild** - Controls technological advancement
- **Merchant Guild** - Regulates trade and commerce
- **Healer Guild** - Oversees all medical practice
- **Farmer Collective** - Protects agricultural interests
- **Artisan Union** - Represents craftsmen
- **Scholar's Circle** - Academic and philosophical body
- **Performance Guild** - Arts and entertainment

Guilds have their own internal hierarchies, political agendas, and sometimes rival provincial authority. Players can join and rise through guild ranks.

## Technology: Whisker-Punk Aesthetic

### Core Philosophy
Technology scaled for cats, powered by renewable resources cats can access naturally, with Ghibli's love of intricate mechanical beauty. Everything is visible, ornate, and celebrates the marriage of nature and engineering.

### Power Sources

#### 1. Whisker-Static Generators
- Cats naturally generate static electricity through movement and grooming
- Large ornate wheels where cats run, play, and exercise
- Beautiful designs encourage use - carved wheels, hanging toys, social spaces
- Powers lighting, small machinery, communication systems
- Collective effort creates community bonds

#### 2. Sun-Warm Collectors
- Solar power reimagined as elaborate sun-bathing platforms
- Cats literally power the grid by napping in designated sunny spots
- Platforms are comfortable, warm, and aesthetically beautiful
- Creates golden-hour glow aesthetic in cities
- Premium napping spots are status symbols

#### 3. Water Wheels & Steam
- Traditional water wheels throughout river systems
- Steam powered by solar-heated water
- Whistling pipes create ambient soundtrack
- Very *Howl's Moving Castle* aesthetic
- Visible, celebrated infrastructure

#### 4. Kinetic Pawpad Paths
- Special decorated paths that generate power when walked on
- Encourages community movement and interaction
- Beautiful tile work, embedded crystals that glow when stepped on
- Connect important buildings and districts

### Transportation Technology

**Paw-Carts:** Small wheeled carts propelled by pedaling (cat-sized bicycles). Range from utilitarian to highly decorated.

**Cable Cars:** Running along wires between buildings and across valleys, powered by counterweight systems.

**Steam Boats:** Cat-scaled boats with tiny ornate smokestacks for river and coastal transportation.

**The Great Claw Railway:** Steam trains connecting all five provinces. Ornate locomotives with comfortable interiors.

### Communication Technology

**Whisker-Wire Telegraph:** Messages sent via vibrations through wire networks. Operators translate vibrations into written messages.

**Message Bells:** Elaborate bell systems for local communication with different tones meaning different things.

**Carrier Moths:** Like carrier pigeons but moths (navigate by moonlight). Used for personal messages and small packages.

**Town Criers:** Traditional method still used for public announcements.

### Manufacturing & Industry

**Automated Looms:** Textile production with visible gears and pulleys. Hypnotic to watch in operation.

**Clockwork Assistants:** Small mechanical helpers (not sentient), like Miyazaki's soot sprites but mechanical. Perform repetitive tasks.

**Paw-Presses:** Printing presses for newspapers and books. Cat-operated with foot pedals.

**Forge-Wheels:** Automated blacksmithing assistance. Hammer mechanisms powered by water/steam.

### Daily Life Technology

**Claw-Vators (Elevators):** In taller buildings, manual pulley systems with counterweights in ornate cages.

**Heat Boxes:** Food warming using captured sun-warmth. Insulated boxes with solar-heated stones.

**Glow-Lanterns:** Bioluminescent plants/fungi cultivated in glass containers. No fire risk, sustainable.

**Wind Chimes:** Double as weather sensors and musical instruments. Create constant gentle ambient music.

**Public Baths (Sentō):** Heated by geothermal or solar-steam. Social centers in every community.

### Medical Technology

**Diagnostic Mirrors:** Polished surfaces that somehow reveal internal issues (magical realism element).

**Herb Distillers:** Elaborate glassware for medicine creation. Alchemical aesthetic.

**Healing Lamps:** Specific light frequencies for treatment using colored glass filters.

**Massage Wheels:** Mechanical therapy devices with smooth rollers and gentle vibration.

**The Pulse Bells:** Diagnostic tool using sound vibration. Different tones indicate different conditions.

### Aesthetic Guidelines

**Materials:** Brass, copper, bronze, wood (especially bamboo and cherry), paper, glass, stone

**Colors:** Warm metals, natural wood tones, soft warm lighting, occasional bright accents

**Shapes:** Organic curves, circular elements, spirals, natural forms integrated with geometric precision

**Sound:** Gentle mechanical purring, steam hissing, bells chiming, gears clicking, water flowing

**Lighting:** Warm and soft - gas lamps, glow-lanterns, candles, never harsh or cold

**Design Philosophy:** Nothing is purely functional - everything has artistic merit, ornamentation tells stories, gears and mechanisms are celebrated not hidden
