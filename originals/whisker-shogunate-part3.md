---

### The Existential Challenge

**The Weight of Sentience:**

For isekai'd cats, the transformation is jarring and creates ongoing challenges:

**Physical Adjustment:**
- Walking upright instead of on all fours
- Using hands/paws with opposable digits
- Speaking complex language instead of meows
- Managing a larger, more capable body

**Mental/Emotional Adjustment:**
- Processing complex emotions beyond basic animal instincts
- Understanding abstract concepts (time, money, politics, art)
- Making meaningful choices instead of following instinct
- Taking responsibility for one's life and actions

**Social Adjustment:**
- Learning social hierarchies and etiquette
- Building relationships based on more than territory or mating
- Contributing to society vs. simply surviving
- Navigating politics, economics, and cultural expectations

**Identity Crisis:**
- "I was a pet/stray/wild animal - now what am I?"
- Reconciling past powerlessness with current agency
- The loneliness of remembering a world that feels like a dream
- Choosing who to become when you can be anyone

---

**Common Struggles:**
- **Overwhelm:** "I just wanted food and warmth, now I need a career?"
- **Purpose Anxiety:** "What am I supposed to do with this life?"
- **Imposter Syndrome:** "Everyone else seems to know how to be a person"
- **Decision Paralysis:** Too many choices after a life of few options
- **Nostalgia:** Missing the simplicity of animal existence
- **Guilt:** Feeling they don't deserve this second chance

---

**The Journey:**

The game loop centers on gradually mastering this transformation:
- Learning skills and finding your calling
- Building a support network
- Creating meaning through work and relationships
- Accepting both your past and your present
- Eventually helping other newcomers through the same journey

**Why It Matters:** This struggle makes the "idle" aspects meaningful - you're not just grinding resources, you're helping your cat find peace, purpose, and identity. Every skill learned, friendship made, and home improvement is progress in becoming who they're meant to be.

- Tonal elements (pitch matters for some words)

*Written Form:*
- Pictographic characters combined with phonetic elements
- Characters based on paw prints, claw marks, and natural forms
- About 2,000 common characters (literacy requires ~1,500)

*Structure:*
