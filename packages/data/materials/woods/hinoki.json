  "culturalNotes": "Hinoki has been the wood of choice for sacred architecture in Neko-kuni since ancient times. Its pleasant scent is believed to have calming properties, making it especially popular in healer temples and meditation spaces. The Artisan Union maintains strict standards for hinoki harvesting to ensure sustainability.",
  "gameplayNotes": "Players pursuing carpentry or architecture paths will need to establish relationships with hinoki suppliers in Mori-shizuka. Master-level projects require hinoki as a key material. The wood's premium cost means it's often a mid-to-late game material for player housing upgrades.",
