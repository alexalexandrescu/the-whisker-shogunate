- 🎯 Priority levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- 📁 File paths for all documentation
- 🔗 Cross-reference tracking
- 📊 Progress toward milestones

**Update this** after every significant change to track progress.

---

### 2. **GLOSSARY.md** - Canonical Terminology
**Location**: `world-building/GLOSSARY.md`

An alphabetical reference of all terms, names, and locations:
- 200+ entries already populated from your brainstorming docs
- Pronunciations for Japanese-inspired terms
- Definitions and first appearances
- Tags for categorization
- "Synonyms to Avoid" section prevents inconsistency

**Add to this** immediately when creating new terms.

---

### 3. **TEMPLATES.md** - Standardized Formats
**Location**: `world-building/TEMPLATES.md`

Five comprehensive templates:
1. **Location Template** - For provinces, cities, landmarks, buildings
2. **Faction/Guild Template** - For organizations and groups
3. **System/Mechanic Template** - For gameplay and social systems
4. **Character/NPC Template** - For named individuals
5. **Technology/Innovation Template** - For Whisker-Punk tech

Each includes:
- [REQUIRED] sections that must be completed
- Optional sections for additional depth
- Quick reference cards
- Cross-reference guidelines
- Completion checklist

**Use these** when creating any new documentation.

---

### 4. **WORKFLOW.md** - Iterative Development Process
**Location**: `world-building/WORKFLOW.md`

Complete guide covering:
- **The Iteration Cycle**: ASSESS → PLAN → CREATE → REVIEW → UPDATE INDEX
- **Creating New Documentation**: Step-by-step process
- **Updating Existing Documentation**: Revision procedures
- **Review & QA**: Quality checklists
- **Consistency Checking**: Preventing contradictions
- **Progress Tracking**: Velocity and milestone measurement
- **Collaboration Guidelines**: Team coordination

**Follow this** for all world-building work.

---

### 5. **README.md** - Quick Start Guide
**Location**: `world-building/README.md`

Your entry point to the system:
- Quick start for new contributors
- Directory structure overview
- Current status at a glance
- Core documents explained
- Design principles and tone
- Quality standards
- Common mistakes to avoid
- FAQ

---

### 6. **Organized Directory Structure**
**Location**: `world-building/`

```
world-building/
├── systems/       # Game mechanics, social systems, core rules
├── locations/     # Provinces, cities, landmarks, buildings
├── factions/      # Guilds, organizations, political groups
├── cultures/      # Cultural elements, traditions, language
├── technology/    # Whisker-Punk tech, infrastructure
├── history/       # Historical events, timelines
├── characters/    # NPCs, leaders, historical figures
├── conflicts/     # Current events, tensions, plots
└── scripts/       # Automation tools
```

**Populate these** as you develop content.

---

### 7. **Example Script**
**Location**: `world-building/scripts/find-todos.sh`

A working example script that:
- Finds all `[To Be Determined]` placeholders
- Locates unchecked checklist items
- Identifies 0% completion topics
- Generates progress report

**Run this** regularly to track remaining work.

**Create similar scripts** for:
- Consistency checking
- Completion calculation
- Cross-reference validation
- Glossary verification

## Questions?

### "Where do I start?"
→ Read `world-building/README.md` then check "Priority Areas" in `INDEX.md`

### "How do I add content?"
→ Follow process in `WORKFLOW.md` → "Creating New Documentation"

### "Is this already defined?"
→ Check `INDEX.md` and look at completion percentage

### "What's the canonical spelling/name?"
→ Look it up in `GLOSSARY.md`

### "I found a contradiction!"
→ Follow process in `WORKFLOW.md` → "Consistency Checking"

### "How complete is X?"
→ Check percentage in `INDEX.md` for that topic

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure system effectiveness:

- **Documentation coverage**: % of identified topics with >50% completion
- **Consistency**: # of contradictions found per iteration (should decrease)
- **Velocity**: Average % completion gain per week
- **Quality**: % of documents passing review checklist first time
- **Usability**: Time to find specific information (should decrease)

---

## Your World-Building System Is Ready!

You now have:
- ✅ **Comprehensive tracking** via INDEX.md (42% complete currently)
- ✅ **Consistency tools** via GLOSSARY.md (200+ terms)
- ✅ **Standardized templates** for 5 content types
- ✅ **Iterative workflow** for sustainable development
- ✅ **Progress visibility** with completion percentages
- ✅ **Quality assurance** with review checklists
- ✅ **Collaboration framework** with clear processes
- ✅ **Automation foundation** with example scripts

**Next**: Start your first iteration! Choose a Critical priority item from `INDEX.md` and follow the workflow to develop it.

**Remember**: World-building is iterative. You don't need perfection upfront. Build structure, add detail progressively, refine through review. The system supports resumable work—document where you are, and you can always pick up exactly where you left off.
